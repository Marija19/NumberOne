1. In my opinion, Coleco was the only company discussed in this chapter has since ceased operation (Intellivision could also be considered but it was a console released by Mattel, which is still an operating company). 
	The video game crash of 1983 that lasted until approx. 1985 caused decreased sales and interest in the gaming community, which was mostly attributed to previously-released, low-quality games and a growing interest in home computers.

2. The connection between Atari and the Commodore computer company is that they were both competing for the game market at the same time.

3. SEGA comes from Services Games. Throughout it's history in the gaming industry, it consistantly failed to live up to the standards of it's competitores and eventualy withdrew from the console market.
