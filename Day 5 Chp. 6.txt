Day 5 Exercises

2. A) 1. Catalyst Wars GDD - I would view this GDD as bad first because while reading through it I got completely confused as to what the intended purpose of the gameplay is, the rules and options being so vast that the actual end-game point is lost.
- the story outline reads like a novel with so many concepts involved that a target audience, as well as any projected timeline is frustrating to discern.
- due to the overload of the game components it felt as if the designer based their entire gameplay on pre-existing, highly-market-competitive games.
- the lack of any distinct description of a title menu, budget system, and especially full-release timeframe (as mention on page 34, it sounded like a "we'll get out what with can and work from there" type of concept), was highly dissappointing.
- non-existant title page and specified marketing analysis.  
      2. Flying GDD 
- complete ouline/table of contents non existant.
- art and audio specifications very vague/non-existant.
- no estimated/specified schedule, budget or release date. No specified target audience or ESRB rating. 

   B) The Claw GDD and Doom GDDs are both succesful forms for a GDD design file because they both:
- are concise and well organized with a clear outline (title pages) that helps the reader not lose focus as to what is expected to be introduced.
- they include a scheduled time frame and an analysis, as well as including schedules and writer infos.
- they explain the world, concept of it as well as the characters, loot and levels in an organized way that is not over-written while adding enough core details to get the concept across.

   C) Compared to modern day GDDs provided, Pole Position GDD and Tempest GDD seem similar in the way that there are set guidelines/bulletpoints for the environment, audio, character and goal description, as well as gameplay.
However, there seemed to be a lot more discussion/focus via intranet memos with regards to the problems being caused by the console the games were being played on, as well as customer dissatisfaction with glitches, etc.
The audio was discussed and market analysis were done and written down, but unlike these old-school games, modern day GDDs seem to focus more on character creation, level, story layout and design than on platform specs and possible failures.
